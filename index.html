        <h1>Successfully Closing the Leads</h1>
        <p><strong>Based on interviews with real estate professionals who close a high volume of online leads-</strong> we identified those who were sustaining small businesses and large teams almost exclusively on online leads and referrals. We compiled information through phone interviews and sharing best practices in our in-person seminars across the nation. We held panel discussions at the big conventions. </p>

        <p><strong>Response times made even a bigger difference than you may think.</strong> There were several techniques that are learnable and repeatable, which we published in the guide-- including handling new incoming leads when you are already with customers.</p>

        <p><b>Preparation helps.</b> Ideas were exchanged on how to handle specific questions about a listing. Included is dialogue for your agents to buy time to re-group and properly prepare if they are not completely ready to take the inquiry.</p>

        <p><strong>Communication needs to be relevant.</strong> Simple dialogue that is well timed and relates to the lead inquiry is not difficult to construct. Several examples of when to communicate and what to say are in this guide.</p>
